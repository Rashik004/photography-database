photography-database
====================

MySQL schema for a film photography database. This database schema can track cameras, lenses, films and negatives.

Some of the tables include sample data which you may wish to keep (e.g. film formats). Others are blank table structures for you to fill with your own data (e.g. cameras).

#### Installation

This is just a set of sql files. Import them into your MySQL or MariaDB instance by running

```
mysql -p < *.sql
```

#### Reference

These subheadings are for each table, and sub-subheadings are for each field.
